This project presents an implementation of the Christofides algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), providing a practical and interactive approach to explore this combinatorial optimization challenge. The TSP seeks the shortest possible route that visits a set of points exactly once and returns to the starting point, which has applications in logistics, robotics, and network optimization. Although finding an exact solution for large TSP instances is computationally infeasible, Christofides' algorithm guarantees a solution that is within 1.5 times the optimal route length, making it a highly efficient approximation technique.

The program is designed with flexibility and user interaction in mind. It allows users to input custom X and Y coordinates or generate random points, choose between Euclidean and Cityblock (Manhattan) distance metrics, and toggle visualization of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). The algorithm first computes the MST of the graph, identifies vertices of odd degree, and performs minimum-weight perfect matching on those vertices to form a multigraph. The multigraph is used to derive an Eulerian circuit, which is then converted into the final TSP tour by shortcutting repeated nodes.

To enhance user experience, the project leverages IPython widgets to facilitate real-time input validation and interactive visualization. Users can observe the constructed tour and MST through dynamic matplotlib plots and export the resulting tour as a CSV file for further analysis. Additionally, the total tour distance is displayed, allowing for easy comparison of different configurations and metrics. This project not only demonstrates the theoretical underpinnings of the Christofides algorithm but also highlights its practical use through visual tools and user-friendly controls. It serves as a valuable learning platform for students and practitioners, providing insights into algorithmic graph theory and optimization strategies. The combination of computational efficiency, visualization, and interactivity makes this implementation a robust tool for exploring approximate solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem.
